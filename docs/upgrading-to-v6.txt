Upgrading to v6
===============

:Version: 6.0.0+beta1

Nikola tries fairly hard to be compatible between versions. However, there were
a few areas which were getting clunky, and needed fxing. So, here's what you may
need to change in your site.

If you need to change anything else, or something breaks, please write at nikola-discuss
and I'll add further tweaks here.

Themes
------

**NOTE**
    The install_theme command is not working yet, get themes from https://github.com/ralsina/nikola-themes

**NOTE**
    There is no equivalent for the jinja-default theme yet. If you have a custom,
    jinja-based theme, upgrading is probably a bad idea right now.


Themes have been renamed:

* site => bootstrap
* orphan => base

Theme added:

* base-jinja

Themes have been moved out of nikola and into nikola-themes:

* default => oldfashioned at nikola-themes
* jinja-default => not there yet, coming soon
* monospace => monospace at nikola-themes
* site-reveal => reveal at nikola-themes

You may have to change your ``THEME`` setting, or change the ``parent`` if you are
using a custom theme. Also, some templates have been tweaked, but nothing should
break for you.

Facebook comments support changed the HTML tag to:

.. code-block: html

    <html% if comment_system == 'facebook': xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"
    %endif lang="${lang}">


Comments
~~~~~~~~

If you want a custom theme to support comment systems other than disqus, you will need to:

1) Replace mentions of disqus_helper.tmpl with comments_helper.tmpl
2) Replace mentions of html_disqus with comment_form
3) Replace mentions of html_disqus_link with comment_link
4) Replace mentions of html_disqus_script with comment_link_script

If you don't, your theme should work just fine, but support only disqus comments. 


Configuration
-------------

A number of options have been renamed. In all cases, the behaviour should be **exactly** as
before. If it's not, let me know. Also, you will get warnings. That doesn't mean things
broke. They are there to inform you of what's happening, and that you need to tweak
your config.

All the deprecated options will work during the v6 cycle, and only be removed in v7, when
those warnings will become errors.
