Nikola supports special links with the syntax ``link://kind/name``. In
templates you can also use ``_link(kind, name)``. You can add query strings
(``?key=value``) for extra arguments, or pass keyword arguments to ``_link`` in
templates (support and behavior depends on path handlers themselves). By default,
you can only link to current language's contents; in order to link to a different
language, use ``link://kind/name?lang=other_lang`` or ``_link(kind, name, lang)``.
Fragments (``#anchor``) will be appended to the transformed link.

Here are the descriptions for all the supported kinds.
