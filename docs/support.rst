Help and Support
================

1. Create a `Discussion on GitHub`_.
2. There’s an IRC channel: #nikola on Libera.Chat.  You can
   find many developers and volunteers (users) there which are there to provide
   help, if they are around and read your message.  The channels are
   `publicly logged <https://irclogs.getnikola.com/>`_.
3. If you are experiencing a bug, you should report it as an Issue on GitHub (see
   below).

Plugins and Themes
------------------

Plugins and Themes from the Indexes are not officially supported.

1. Create a `Discussion on GitHub`_, which may or may not work out.
2. You can also try the IRC channel if the theme/plugin is very popular.
3. Report an issue at the `plugins issue tracker`_ or at the `themes
   issue tracker`_.
4. Contact the author of the plugin/theme.  The name of the author of a
   plugin is available in the ``.plugin`` and ``.py`` files.  Tracking
   down theme authors can be much harder due to how our architecture
   works (but certainly is doable).

Report a Bug, Request a Feature
===============================

Bug reports should be sent to the `Issue tracker`_ at GitHub.

Feature requests should be sent to the `Issue tracker`_ or in a `Discussion on GitHub`_, especially if they require further discussion.

Administrativia
===============

If you are in need of getting administrativia resolved, you may want
to e-mail info@getnikola.com and therefore contact the people behind the
project.  Note that this email **may not** be used for support matters.
Messages are forwarded to all administrators.  If you need to
contact them individually, you can find their names and
personal addresses below.
