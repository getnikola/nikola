This is a theme based on Bootstrap 5.

The theme is a good building block for a site. It is based on a simple navbar +
content layout. For a more blog-style layout, check out `bootblog5`.

Note that unlike previous versions of Bootstrap, icon fonts are not built-in.
You can use Font Awesome for this.

This theme supports Bootswatch and HackerThemes font/color schemes
through the `nikola subtheme` command.
