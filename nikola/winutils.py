    Most (all?) of git implementations in windows store a symlink pointing
    into the repo as a text file, the text being the relative path to the
    file with the real content.

    So, in a clone of nikola in windows the symlinked files will have the
    wrong content; a .zip download from Github has the same problem.

    This function will rewrite each symlinked file with the correct contents, but
    keep in mind that the working copy will be seen as dirty by git after operation.

    Expects to find a list of symlinked files at nikola/data/symlinked.txt

    The list can be generated by scripts/generate_symlinked_list.sh , which is
    basically a redirect of
         cd nikola_checkout
         git ls-files -s | awk '/120000/{print $4}'

    Weakness: if interrupted of fail amidst a directory copy, next run will not
    see the missing files.
